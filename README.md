# python-string-assignment
Description
This Python program is an **interactive text manipulator** that lets the user choose from different string operations in a menu-driven format. It can reverse text, count vowels, check palindromes, find and replace words, format into formal title case, split sentences into words, count word frequencies, and swap letter cases. The loop continues until the user chooses **Exit**.
